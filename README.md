# EX-02-Cross-Platform-Prompting-Evaluating-Diverse-Techniques-in-AI-Powered-Text-Summarization

## AIM:
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

## Scenario:
You are part of a content curation team for an educational platform that delivers quick summaries of research papers to undergraduate students. Your task is to summarize a 500-word technical article on "The Basics of Blockchain Technology" using multiple AI platforms and prompting strategies.

## Algorithm:


# ChatGPT (GPT-4.5)
## 1. Zero-Shot Prompting

Prompt: "Summarize the following article."
Summary:
Quantum computing uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in fundamentally new ways. Instead of classical bits (0 or 1), it uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition. Entanglement allows qubits to be linked, enabling powerful parallel computations. Quantum computers can solve certain problems, like factoring large numbers or simulating molecules, much faster than classical computers. However, challenges such as error correction, decoherence, and building stable hardware remain major obstacles.

## 2. Few-Shot Prompting

Prompt: "Here are examples of summaries for technical articles. [Provide 2–3 examples.] Now, summarize the following article."
Summary:
Quantum computing leverages qubits, which use superposition and entanglement to represent and process data in parallel. This allows them to perform certain tasks far more efficiently than classical computers, such as cryptography and materials science simulations. Despite the promise, current devices face hurdles in scaling up, minimizing errors, and maintaining stability.

## 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Prompt: "Let's think step-by-step. First, explain how quantum computing works, then summarize its key applications."
Summary:
Quantum computers store information in qubits that can be in multiple states at once, enabling massive parallelism. Entanglement provides additional computational power by linking qubits. These properties make quantum computing especially useful in areas like cryptography, drug discovery, and optimization. Yet, the technology is still in early development and faces challenges with error correction and maintaining coherence.

## 4. Role-Based Prompting

Prompt: "You are a professional content curator for students. Summarize the article in simple terms."
Summary:
Think of a quantum computer as a supercharged version of today’s computers. Instead of flipping coins that are either heads or tails (0 or 1), quantum computers use special coins (qubits) that can be both at once. When lots of them work together, they can solve really tough problems like cracking codes or designing medicines. But right now, scientists are still figuring out how to make them reliable and practical.

# Gemini (Google)
## 1. Zero-Shot Prompting

Summary:
Quantum computing is based on qubits, which can exist in superposition and entanglement. This allows them to perform calculations far beyond the reach of classical computers. While promising for applications such as cryptography, logistics, and drug design, quantum computers are still limited by issues of stability and scalability.

## 2. Few-Shot Prompting

Summary:
Quantum computing uses qubits that can hold multiple values at once. With superposition and entanglement, these systems enable faster problem-solving in areas like data security and molecular research. The field progress is steady but faces difficulties such as error correction and hardware limitations.

## 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Summary:
Quantum computing works by using qubits that can exist in overlapping states and become entangled with each other. This structure allows quantum machines to perform parallel computations. The technology could transform industries ranging from healthcare to finance. However, error rates and maintaining coherence remain serious barriers to large-scale use.

## 4. Role-Based Prompting

Summary:
Imagine a computer that doesn’t just think in 0s and 1s, but in many possibilities at the same time. That’s quantum computing. It could change how we discover new medicines, secure information, or even design better materials. Right now, though, quantum computers are still experimental and not ready to replace our everyday laptops.

# Claude (Anthropic)
## 1. Zero-Shot Prompting

Summary:
Quantum computing is a new model of computation using qubits instead of bits. With properties like superposition and entanglement, qubits can perform many calculations simultaneously. This gives quantum computers unique advantages in fields like cryptography, optimization, and scientific simulations. Current limitations include noise, decoherence, and hardware complexity.

## 2. Few-Shot Prompting

Summary:
Unlike classical computers, quantum computers use qubits that can represent multiple states at once. This enables problem-solving approaches far more efficient for certain complex tasks, including breaking encryption and modeling molecules. Despite potential, the field is still emerging, with practical quantum systems not yet fully realized.

## 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Summary:
Quantum computers work by encoding data into qubits, which can be in superpositions of states and entangled with each other. This allows for parallel computation, giving them theoretical advantages in cryptography, search, and materials science. However, error correction and scaling challenges keep quantum computers largely experimental.

## 4. Role-Based Prompting

Summary:
Picture a computer that can test many answers at the same time instead of one by one. That’s how quantum computers work with qubits. They might one day help us create new medicines or keep information safe. But for now, scientists are still working on making them stable and reliable.
